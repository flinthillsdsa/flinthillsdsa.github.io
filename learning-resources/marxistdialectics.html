  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Marx: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm">Holy Family: The Mystery of Speculative Construction</a> and <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch08_4.htm">The Revealed Mystery of The “Standpoint”</a>. Gives a general critique of the idealist method in the manner of a demystification. Not fully Marxist yet (it’s arguably the breaking point with Feuerbach), but important.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Marx: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm">Theses On Feuerbach</a>. The breakthrough to Marxism, where Marx overcomes both the German Idealist tradition and the old materialism. Very dense and requires a lot of knowledge of the named traditions to fully be grasped, but you can still get something out of it without that knowledge. I’d argue Marx and Engels unfold and develop these theses in German Ideology, which makes things easier.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Marx and Engels: German Ideology: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01.htm">Feuerbach: Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlooks</a>. They develop historical materialism (pay close attention on the stress they put on the relations of production here) and lay down some fundamentals of dialectical materialism. In this interrelated explanation it is clear that both aspects of Marxism cannot be separated without destroying them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Marx: Poverty of Philosophy: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm">The Method</a>. Proudhon had a second hand, vulgarized understanding of Hegelian dialectics and Marx felt it needed correction and clarification how things really work. In doing that he left us one of his few direct investigations of dialectics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Marx: Grundrisse: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm">Introduction</a>. I think this is Marx’ deepest, fairly direct treatment of materialist dialectics. Difficult read that should be studied again and again, but there’s much of great import here.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Marx: Contribution: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm">Preface</a>. Very general lines on historical and dialectical materialism. Very influential. Should be read carefully, because some take a mechanistic and economistic reading out of this that’s not Marx’ intention.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Marx: Capital I: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/part0.htm">Prefaces and Afterwords</a>. Includes general remarks, a longer excerpt from a Russian reviewer on method that Marx approves of and an applied example regarding the decline and transformation of political economy. As Lenin first pointed out, Capital itself is of course the greatest example of the application of the Marxist method.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Engels: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">Anti-Dühring</a>. Introductions and Part I: Philosophy. Engels gives a general outline of Marx’ and his views regarding philosophical problems, science and the historical development of human thought. Including three chapters on the most basic movements of materialist dialectics. Later reworked into the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</a> pamphlet, so I’ll only list Anti-Dühring here. Printed versions should also have his notes on this book, which include more interesting and important thoughts on materialist dialectics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Engels: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/index.htm">Dialectics of Nature</a>. Engels late, unfinished masterpiece. He studied the natural sciences for more than a decade to write this. Most of it remained fragmentary, however it includes chapters and fragments on dialectics, the Marxist understanding of the sciences and their relation to dialectical thought, a still very important struggle against empiricism that permeates the entire book, etc. In times of the Anthropocene this might be one of the most important Marxist books.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Engels: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/index.htm">Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy</a>. Engels outlines the development of Marxism out of its heritage in German Idealism. He defends this heritage against the vulgarization of neo-Kantianism that had already set in at that point (see Lukács for the deeper causes of this still ongoing phenomenon of the rot of bourgeois philosophy). Engels was the first to take up the fight against this.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Stalin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1906/12/x01.htm">Anarchism Or Socialism?</a>. One the funniest texts of Marxism, imo. Stalin gives a rundown of the basics of historical and dialectical materialism in an easy to understand, polemical fashion. Great for beginners.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lenin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/index.htm">Materialism and Empirio-criticism</a>. After the defeat of the 1905-06 Russian Revolution neo-Kantian and positivist philosophical positions took a hold within the ranks of the Bolsheviks, prompting Lenin to write his longest worked out philosophical work. Building on Engels, Feuerbach and Dietzgen, this is largely focused on epistemology, the theory of science and materialism. Contrary to the popular cliché Lenin is not an undialectical thinker here (he never was).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lenin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm">The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism</a>. Gives a short theorization of the main elements of Marxism as a whole.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lenin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/pdf/lenin-cw-vol-38.pdf">Philosophical Notebooks</a>. The core of this is Lenin’s study of Hegel’s Logic, which is in essence a Marxist demystification of Hegel. These studies were crucial in his theorization of imperialism and the struggle against its effects within the labor movement (the revisionism of the Second International, the national question, the labor aristocracy, etc.). Woefully under read, this is Lenin’s most important philosophical work and it has influenced the greatest philosophers in Marxism (Mao, Ilyenkov, Lukács).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lenin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/granat/index.htm">Karl Marx</a>. Written during his Hegel studies, this is a masterpiece of theoretical condensation and includes an account of materialist dialectics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lenin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/jan/25.htm">Once Again On The Trade Unions</a>. Forced by the mistakes of Trotsky and Bukharin, Lenin gives a brief but pointed discussion of the basics of dialectics, with an important differentiation to eclecticism (which Marx already always stressed as characteristic for petite bourgeois thought).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lenin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/mar/12.htm">On the Significance of Militant Materialism</a>. A brief text in which Lenin stresses the importance of materialist dialectics for the natural sciences in particular as well as the relation of the Marxist philosopher to the natural scientists.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mao: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm">On Practice</a>. A fantastically accessible, deep presentation of the basics of dialectical materialism.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mao: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm">On Contradiction</a>. Mao advances the Marxist theory of contradiction in this crucial masterpiece of materialist dialectics. Here as well as in On Practice he built on Lenin’s Philosophical Notebooks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Stalin: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm">Dialectical and Historical Materialism</a>. Stalin’s classical presentation. Much maligned and indeed flawed (arguably its greatest error is a complete omission of the core of dialectics, the unity of opposites), this is still a good introductory text to Marxism. It just shouldn’t be read as an exhaustive account of Marxism.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Thalheimer: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/thalheimer/works/diamat/index.htm">Introduction to Dialectical Materialism</a>. Easy read well suited for beginners. Has the advantage of giving an historical approach and including interesting stuff on the Indian and Chinese heritage. He’s also trying a deduction as the three basic laws of dialectics as given by Engels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Plekhanov: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/plekhanov/1895/monist/index.htm">The Development of the Monist View of History</a>. Also accessible (not quite so much as Thalheimer) and with a historical approach (not reaching as deep into time as Thalheimer, but going deeper in terms of content). Very insgihtful regarding the genesis of historical materialism too.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ilyenkov: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/positive/index.htm">Leninist Dialectics &amp; Metaphysics of Positivism</a>. A polemic against the positivism taking a hold in the Brezhnev era of the USSR. Ilyenkov defends and contextualizes Lenin’s Empiriocriticism polemic and attacks Bogdanov’s techno-fetishist visions of the future (relevant for Americans and their still prevalent techno fetish).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lukács: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm">What is Orthodox Marxism?</a>. He’s stressing the crucial role of dialectics to Marxism. Written in the struggle against the mechanistic tradition that had developed through the Second International.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lukács: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/1926/moses-hess.htm">Moses Hess and the Problems of Idealist Dialectics</a>. Brilliant analysis of the dead-ends of the attempts to overcome the Hegelian tradition along the path of idealism. Elucidates the philosophical achievements of Marx and Engels. Still works against these attempts that haven’t stopped, naturally (since their roots in bourgeois society persist).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pilling: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/pilling/works/capital/index.htm">Marx’s Capital</a>. Great elucidation of Marx’ method. Informed by Lenin’s Hegel studies, Ilyenkov’s study of Capital, Rubin’s analysis of commodity fetishism and Rosdolsky’s analysis of the Grundrisse. He was a trot, so there’s some unnecessary Stalin bashing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ilyenkov: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/index.htm">Dialectical Logic</a>. A book length analysis of the modern dialectical tradition from Descartes to Lenin, critically analyzing the emergence and development of materialist dialectics up to that point. Brilliant but advanced stuff.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ilyenkov: <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/abstract/index.htm">Dialectics of the Abstract &amp; the Concrete in Marx’s Capital</a>. Imo still the finest analysis of Marx’ method in Capital.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lukács: <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-destruction-of-reason-by-gyorgy-lukacs">Destruction of Reason</a>. Lukács investigates the roots of fascist ideology in the tradition of German philosophy (he’s not claiming that this is an exclusively German phenomenon) and the causes for the decline of bourgeois philosophy after Hegel, especially after the bourgeoisie had secured its rule in 1871 and the working class had emerged as the new historical force threatening bourgeois society. Not that difficult to read but necessitates some understanding of Hegel to get the central thesis.</p>
